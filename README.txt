*** HOW TO INSTALL ***

Extract the download archive directly into your MCP-directiory.
It should create a folder "BAPI" within that directory, containing all 
extracted files.

You should use freshly downloaded jars, solely including ModLoader in the 
client jar and minecraft forge sources folder in your MCP directory. Anything 
else can eventually cause conflicts.

If the automatic download of fernflower fails you can get it here
http://goo.gl/PnJHp. Extract fernflower.jar into your MCP's runtime/bin folder.

Now just start the install.cmd/.sh, BAPI will install itself into the proper
locations and copy all needed files, as well as modifying the needed baseclasses
and start the forge installation aswell.

The install scripts should take care of everything for you, so you should not need
to run ANY MCP NOR FORGE script before installing BAPI.
